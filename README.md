# My_Watchlist

This is the react-native app that I have developed during the react-native course offered by the Metropolia University in Finland.
To make it work you will have to copy the KEYS.js file manually in the asset folder.
You can get the key from here: http://www.omdbapi.com/

This is a simple app for keeping track of the movies and series you are watching
